## Motivation

Tooling for inline source code documentation of Scheme code is rare.
Existing tools like [chibi-doc][chibi-doc source] actually interpret/load the code and thus do not work if, for example, some utilized libraries are not available for `chibi-scheme`.
To overcome this limitation `scmdoc` takes a different approach were the code is not interpreted and only parsed.
This allows `scmdoc` to be applicable to different R⁷RS implementations ([CHICKEN][chicken web], [Guile][guile web], [Gambit][gambit web], [Racket][racket r7rs], …) as long as the input is syntactically valid R⁷RS.
Pattern matching is then performed on parsed S-expressions to format them nicely in the generated documentation (e.g. matching for procedure definitions, library definitions, …).
In its essence, `scmdoc` is therefore a glorified pattern matcher for S-expressions.

## Status

This is currently a proof-of-concept.
The R7RS parser should support the majority of the standard but is not well tested.
Furthermore, only a very limited subset of R7RS expressions is matched at the moment (procedure definitions, constant definitions, library declarations).
Lastly, a preliminary HTML generation backend is available.

## Installation

This software can be installed using the following commands:

    $ git clone git://git.8pit.net/scmdoc.git
    $ cd scmdoc
    $ cabal install

Afterwards, the binary should be available via `~/.cabal/bin/scmdoc`.

## Tests

Unit tests are available and can be invoked using the following command:

    $ cabal test

## Approach

The `scmdoc` tool is structured around R7RS Scheme libraries.
For a given Scheme source file, it extracts all library declaration which are prefixed by a doc comment.
Contrary to a normal Scheme comment, a doc comment has the form `;;>`.
As such, `scmdoc` would for example recognize the following library declaration:

    ;;> My awesome scheme library
    (define-library (sample-library)
        …)

For each recognized library, `scmdoc` expands all includes in the declaration and then extracts all exported and documented expressions from the library.
The recognized expressions are then further processed by high-level formatters which recognize S-expressions constituting Scheme procedure definitions et cetera.
These formatters are available in `src/SchemeDoc/Format` and essentially perform pattern matching on arbitrary S-expressions.
For example, the formatter for Scheme procedure definitions roughly looks as follows:

    mkProcedure :: Sexp -> Maybe Procedure
    mkProcedure (List ((Id "define"):(List ((Id defid):arglst)):bodylst)) =
        -- Convert the S-expression into an algebraic data structure
        -- which represents Scheme Procedure definitions and can be
        -- formated.
    mkProcedure _ = Nothing

In the future, it should be possible to also supply custom formatters to, for example, to generate documentation for definitions defined using custom macros.

## Usage

The `scmdoc` tool generates HTML from a Scheme input defining a R7RS library.
As described above, only documented S-expressions for which a documentation formatter is available are included in the generated documentation.
In order to demonstrate generation of HTML documentation consider the following input file called `library.scm`:

    ;;> This is my documented library.
    (define-library (math arithmetic)
      (export my-proc my-magic-constant)

      ;; This is a normal comment which is not considered by scmdoc.
      (begin
        ;;> this is a hidden helper function which is not exported.
        (define my-mult *)

        ;;> my-proc multiplies the given value with two.
        (define (my-proc x)
          (my-mult x 2))

        ;;> A magic constant.
        (define my-magic-constant 42)))

In order to generate HTML documentation, using `scmdoc`, for this library run the following command:

    $ scmdoc library.scm

Within documentation comments, it is possible to use Markdown markup.

### Section Comments

Due to the lack of type information, it is difficult to meaningfully group Scheme program components.
For this reason, `scmdoc` relies on manually inserted *section comments* for grouping.
A section comment is a documentation comment which starts with a `|` character and is followed by an empty line and a normal documentation comment.
The section comment corresponds to the section title, the documentation comment following it functions as the section description.
For example:

    ;;>| Multiplication Procedures

    ;;> Procedures for performing multiplication

    ;;> Multiply two signed values.
    (define (multS x y) …)

This will group the procedure `multS` into the section *“Multiplication Procedures”*.
Every section comment *must* be followed by a normal documentation comment.
Each documented Scheme library *should* contain at least one section comment.

### Look and Feel

The HTML generated by `scmdoc` should be compatible with any [classless CSS framework][cssbed web].
By default, the [water.css][water.css web] dark theme is used.
A custom CSS stylesheet can be specified using the `--stylesheet` command-line.
For more information on classless CSS frameworks refer to [this blog post][greenfield classless].
